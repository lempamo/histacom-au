Histacom is a game about a handy time travel program for Windows 95.
Histacom.AU is one of many attempts to revive that game.

Currently, there is not much to see. The first level consists of an
endless teal void with a mouse cursor floating around in it. I had to
start *somewhere*.

## Dependencies
