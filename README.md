Histacom.AU is another revival of that there game about "hacking".
You can pronounce it "Histacom Gold" if you like pretentious names that
are clearly pronounced differently to how they're written.

You can't play it yet. I'm making an overambitious technical base first,
just like every other revival of this project.
