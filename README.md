Histacom is a game about a handy time travel program for Windows 95.
Histacom.AU is one of many attempts to revive that game.

Currently, there is not much to see, just a half-finished launcher
window. If you want to run it for some reason, you will need Python 2
with the pygame_sdl2 and PIL modules.
