Histacom.AU is another revival of that there game about "hacking".
You can pronounce it "Histacom Gold" if you like pretentious names that
are clearly pronounced differently to how they're written.

I should probably let you know that this project is completely
non-canonical and unauthorised. I will be asking for some kind of
endorsement if and when I make something playable, but for now, the
canon continues at: https://github.com/TimeHACKDevs/TimeHACK
